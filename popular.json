The DCJ was arrested for a number of alleged criminal offences including abuse of office, tax evasion and involvement in the fall of Imperial Bank.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The case has since sent tongues wagging, with different people viewing it as a stab on the heart of the much-popularized handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition kingpin Raila Odinga.<\/p><p><strong>Divided along opinion lines<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p><p>People are at odds over the arrest of the DCJ. On the one side are those who are commending the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP Noordin Hajji for his efforts towards eradicating corruption &ndash; or what seems like it. To them, he is a symbol of hope that somehow this lethal disease (corruption) that has been eating the country for so long can be dealt with. On the other, sits a group of Philomena Mwilu sympathizers who feel that this arrest was politically instigated.<\/p><p>Just hours after DCJ Mwilu was arrested at Supreme Court in Nairobi, Lawyer James Orengo was quick to argue that the move was driven by &apos;other factors&apos;. &nbsp;Even Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka, who has not practiced law in decades, has since joined the legal fight for the DCJ. &nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Targeting specific individuals<\/strong><\/p><p>In the past weeks, Deputy President William Ruto has been heard on many occasions complaining that the fight against corruption is politicized and aimed at targeting specific individuals. But Kenyans were fast to attack and call him names. As it is, a portion of the populace seems to now buy into his sentiments.&nbsp;<\/p><p>ODM Party also cast their doubts on the way this arrest was carried out, and was heard through a statement by their chairman John Mbadi, saying that this could be a possible &apos;political arrest&apos;.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Not any ordinary case<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Looking at how the past arrests on cases touching on judicial officers such as Justice Tunoi and Former Deputy Chief Justice Nancy Baraza were conducted, it can clearly be deduced that this arrest was not ordinary. A witch hunt to be precise. For example, the two cases were processed through the Judicial Service Commission, JSC, an option that was not presented here. Any sitting judges&apos; conduct is usually investigated by JSC which in turn recommends a tribunal.<\/p><p>Attempting to wash hands off the &apos;politically instigated&apos; opinion, a jubilee politician said the President had earlier on, before heading to the US, asked the Office of the DPP to take its time in handling the case. They said that DCJ Mwilu&apos;s case was among the 500 dossiers that had been handed to the president.<\/p><p><strong>Putting it all together&hellip;<\/strong><\/p><p>Going back to when the August 8 General Elections were nullified, the President went on record swearing, \"we will revisit\", a jibe that was directed to the judiciary.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Kenyans are yet to forget these remarks. And right about now, looking at how the arrest was handled, one could argue that the &apos;revisit&apos; time has just begun. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Well, some analysts are arguing that the timing of the arrest can be termed as bad considering how charged the country is. And this case could make or see to the dust, the good work that the DPP&apos;s office has put forward before in attempting to fight corruption.<\/p><p>Whether any of this is the correct position remains to be seen.

This entrepreneurship thing had turned me into I-don&apos;t-know-exactly-what!<\/p><p>I had no peers because most, if not all of my friends were enjoying their fat salaries and the few who claimed to be in business, were either having it as a &apos;side hustle&apos; or had been there too long&hellip; I just couldn&apos;t relate.<\/p><p>My options&hellip;well I didn&apos;t have options.

Where is the essence of showing all that attention and concern only after we have lost the life? What is in the death of our people that inspire so much in us to give them pompous sendoff while sometimes they died forlorn, desperate or even lacking friends to show them care and love?<\/p><p>We tend to not bother to turn our heads when these people call for our attention. We bring them no food when they are hungry. We create no time to go and laugh with them, but we cry gingerly when they eventually pass away. Isn&apos;t that hypocrisy at its best?<\/p><p><strong>Funeral WhatsApp groups, the most abused service <\/strong><\/p><p>Recently, while I was scrolling down my WhatsApp messages, I was perplexed to find myself in a WhatsApp group for a funeral arrangement. Nobody had asked to add me there, but there I was nonetheless.<\/p><p>Of late I have been suffering, I always find myself added to various WhatsApp groups where there is need for serious financial contribution. I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s because I finished campus and I&apos;m expected to start giving back to the society or what. If it is not a wedding then it&apos;s some project that someone is starting somewhere. Or, sometimes, someone wants to be bailed out in some way. But mostly, it&apos;s often a wedding.<\/p><p>Notably, while WhatsApp has brought us this option of groups; a great service indeed, people are taking it too far &ndash; invading others&apos; privacy without warning. You just pick a guy and add him to a group, and you don&apos;t explain a thing.<\/p><p>I don&apos;t have a problem contributing, but manners! Friends, manners! Explain to me first, then allow me to decide if I can help you or not. You can&apos;t always be snubbing me; no greetings, but when you hit the ground, you squeeze me into your WhatsApp groups.<\/p><p>Apparently, this friend of mine had lost the father who had been ailing for way too long but I didn&apos;t know about it. A message about his sickness didn&apos;t reach me but when he died, I had to know about it.<\/p><p>The group wasn&apos;t meant to bring us together and cry but it was supposed to raise funds for funeral arrangements. The aggregated cost was about 800,000 shillings just to take the old man six feet below the ground. People contributed generously.<\/p><p>I didn&apos;t know whether a WhatsApp group had been created earlier to raise funds to offset a hospital bill or to help the man get health care. I don&apos;t know. But I&apos;m sure it wasn&apos;t there because I would have been added there.<\/p><p>Why spend close to a million Kenya shillings on a funeral?<\/p><p><strong>Why waste too much?<\/strong><\/p><p>Do we really have a reason for spending so much on funerals? Why plunder resources on a dead person? Aren&apos;t we Africans still hanging on the old popular but baseless belief that dead people bless the living? That we must give them a &apos;dignified&apos; burial in order to get their blessings? If they bless us, why do they leave us here in a miserable life? Why do we cry when they go to the other side to bless us?<\/p><p>Look, get a simple but decent coffin and put in the peaceful corpse; plunge him or her into the ground. This should take barely four hours to accomplish. Then we can condole with the family by offering some cash to help in various ways.<\/p><p>The business of going to pour money on someone&apos;s funeral is outdated and regressive. Muslims bury their dead immediately in a simple ceremony, and we aren&apos;t any better than them.<\/p><p><strong>Let&apos;s spend on the living, not the dead! <\/strong><\/p><p>Let&apos;s help people stop dying prematurely by caring for them, help them out while they live. And in the unfortunate event of death, very little should be spent on the funeral.<\/p><p>Let&apos;s celebrate life not death by communing with one another while alive. Personally, I&apos;ll be willing and happy to help with medical bills rather than raise funds for funeral arrangements. Because whichever way you look at it, it&apos;s more prudent to help preserve life than wait to celebrate the loss of it. &nbsp;<\/p>","content_min":"<p>Isn&apos;t it ridiculous how we languish in poverty yet spend lots and lots of cash on funeral arrangements when our friends and relatives pass on?

What are they representing?<\/p><p><strong>Back to my point<\/strong><\/p><p>I am convinced that if this country wanted to, and if we became more rational about these matters, ALL the functions of the National Assembly can be performed by the Senate &ndash; with a lot of ease and competence!

There was a design and a contractor. The contractor was the jack of all trades. He knew how to source for the most affordable materials and he had a number of experts working on his side. Projects were simple, technology was less advanced and there was a level of honesty. That was then.<\/p><p><strong>Times have changed<\/strong><\/p><p>Through the decades and with the evolution of technology, different players in the industry have found it increasingly difficult to be the &apos;jack of all trades&apos; due to the depth of mastery required to deliver effectively on the various aspects of construction.<\/p><p>What were formerly &apos;whole-works&apos; are today broken down into much smaller specialized &apos;sub-works&apos;.<\/p><p><strong>Enter the broker\/contractor<\/strong><\/p><p>At the very core of each sub-discipline, there is always good competition which inevitably drives up the quality and drives down the intrinsic costs. It is however unfortunate that the improved quality and lowered costs rarely reach the intended beneficiary-The Buyer.<\/p><p><strong>This is why:<\/strong><\/p><p>By the time the &apos;Contractor&apos; comes on board, the developer has no idea that he is dealing with an accomplished broker and not an expert.<\/p><p>This is how the modern-day contractor\/broker prepares his bid:<\/p><p>First, he asks all the different specialized smaller companies to submit to him their bids for sections of the works. He then sums all these up, adds his markup, then taxes and finally the amount of money that he has to borrow to finance the project before he puts in a claim for payment.<\/p><p>In practice, the developer generally ends up paying more than double the actual cost of the project.<\/p><p>Naturally, the developer will then add his own markup and cost of financing before selling to you an apartment at those rates we are all crying about now.<\/p><p>Obviously, this approach to things cannot deliver anything affordable; not in this country and not in the near future.<\/p><p><strong>Who can save us?<\/strong><\/p><p>I have thought about this for a while and only one group of people come to mind: The Consultants (<strong>Engineers, Architects, and Quantity Surveyors<\/strong>).<\/p><p>I have been toying with the idea of turning the current crop of consultants into project managers for real. Some of them already call themselves project managers but those are really just titles. If they became actual project managers, they would immediately replace the entity of the contractor\/broker and then be in charge of sourcing for the different specialists and materials on behalf of the developer.<\/p><p>In turn, we can reward them with a decent project manager&apos;s fee. Believe you me, these consultants will make a lot more money than they are making currently, but more importantly, the following will happen:<\/p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will be possible to save up to 40% on cost of construction by replacing the contractor with a project manager who is paid fees.<\/p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The real people who actually get the works done will have an opportunity to grow.<\/p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Chinese will go back to their motherland because we will have sealed the loopholes through which they are ripping off our country<\/p><p>Do I still have to explain why the government&apos;s affordable housing scheme will not work?

They hold papers that are not genuinely theirs.<\/p><p>Exam cheating has hit the roof in our learning institutions. This, in part, has led to the so called half-baked or no baked graduates.<\/p><p>The students fail to nurture their God given talents. They totally burry their heads in the sand, hoping to be absorbed by the job market after four, five or six years of study. It&apos;s then, after graduation, that they realize that there may be no jobs for the half-baked after all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Institutions are also to blame<\/strong><\/p><p>There is massive admission of students into the university and colleges by the infamous Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS), yet the government fails to put in place adequate facilities and personnel to provide the desired standards of learning.<\/p><p>Chocked lecture halls, strained lab facilities, inadequate and insufficient learning equipment, and high student&ndash;teacher ratio or student&ndash;faculty ratio have become the order of the day in the country&apos;s institutions of higher learning.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>There has to be a change in mindset about success in life &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p><p>The perceived idea that only the book warmers become successful in life has been proven inaccurate.

Financial institutions advise so, and sometimes even seek for proof of what one intends to use the loan for before giving it out. This is the moral law that governs any lending transaction.<\/p><p>One of the most, if not the most, popular loans in Kenya is Higher Education Loans Board (HELB) loan. I remember I started hearing about this loan when I was in high school (form one). The university students made it easily known to us that it was the campus spoiler, that it was huge and you could spend it the way you wanted.<\/p><p><strong>The reality<\/strong><\/p><p>Despite those many theories and teeter talks that made us have a poor picture of the loan, when I got to campus, I found that the loan was in the first place very lean. In many instances I finished it within two weeks. I know some of my friends who could dry it out within two days or so. It just ran out so fast. And some of my friends even speculated whether HELB had some magical wand that you could dry it out that fast and didn&apos;t see anything you did with it.<\/p><p>Being in campus comes with some clout. You need to have the latest phone, a woofer or home theatre, 32inch HD TV. And some feel a nudge for weekend raves; drink some expensive liquor. These among many other factors have made students misuse the money.<\/p><p>When they finish campus, they are faced with a reality; that they have to pay back the money and that there are no jobs readily awaiting them.<\/p><p><strong>Why HELB loans should be stopped<\/strong><\/p><p>Why should you give a loan to someone who cannot support him\/herself on basic needs and expect them to use it wisely? How do you give loans while you have not provided opportunities for jobs? I mean every lender must be assured of the borrower&apos;s capacity to pay back the loan. Why must the son\/daughter of a poor family or an orphan be given a loan while education has now lost its ancient glory?<\/p><p>We have ended up teaching our youths that loans are to be expended on needs rather than invested, because we have given them loans to spend in campus. They have spent it on drinking sprees, buying home theatres, and many other menial luxuries.<\/p><p>Today we have people who still believe they should take loans to keep themselves comfortable, rather than invest. They apply for loans to take their girlfriends out or for wedding arrangements. Haven&apos;t we messed up our youths?<\/p><p><strong>Between a rock and a hard place<\/strong><\/p><p>While students are given loans, they are not guaranteed a sustaining job. A job that will help them pay back the loan. Truth be told, there is not a grievous problem this country faces more than jobless youth.<\/p><p>Many have graduated and have no jobs. They need to survive, so some resort to crime, some work really hard; even putting their lives in danger. But I also know a host of youths who have ventured into loan taking spree &ndash; as the rich bourgeoisies have come up with various loan businesses: Branch, Tala, Mkopa, Mshwari, Jambo loans, Haraka loans, Said, Easy Loans, Sasa Loans among many others. These are meant to apprehend the jobless youth to a difficult situation. The Kenyan youth is now between a rock and a hard place.<\/p><p><strong>What should be done<\/strong><\/p><p>Students need what I may call &apos;HELP&apos; (Healthy and Educative Lifestyle Pocket) Money. HELP them. Rather than put the youths who are brilliant but financially unstable through this gutter of life, a life full of loans but few opportunities.<\/p><p>The government has to reconsider. Start giving pocket money rather than loans to students. Even if the pocket money is lean. Sponsor their tuition fees the way it has been done but never give loans to students, award them small pocket money to help them meet their basic needs.<\/p><p>We can&apos;t continue having a government and a society which runs on loans and debts from students to the national level. To continue giving loans to students is not only bad for the economy but it also harms the students&apos; lives after campus. The loan conditions the students to be poor investors and loan impropriators.<\/p>","content_min":"<p>With my scanty knowledge of commerce and economics, I know that loans are meant for investing rather than spending.

I&apos;m not referring to commercial clubbing activity, but the liquor-laden type of merriment that Kenyan youths love so much. It&apos;s typically something organized by a group of students or some like-minded, fun-thirsty young folk in a residential place; often a big house with several rooms.<\/p><p><strong>Loud music. Drinks. Corridors. And many rooms&hellip;<\/strong><\/p><p>In these setups, young people lose their senses. They become uninhibited and spontaneous, and the use of condoms or safe sex overall becomes a myth.<\/p><p>Much as you may be unaware, there&apos;s quite a lot of these parties that happen nearly every day. And HIV always finds a way to change hands. &nbsp;<\/p><p>With this picture in mind, you begin to see why our Kenya has just been ranked FOURTH WORLDWIDE in HIV infections, trailing only South Africa, Nigeria and India.<\/p><p>Even more importantly, you begin to see why more than half (51%) of all new HIV infections in Kenya in the report involve young people aged 15-24 years. &nbsp;<\/p><p>This is particularly worrying, because it means the very generation that we hope to drive our economy and take custody of it tomorrow is the most affected; the one we&apos;re losing to HIV AIDS.<\/p><p><strong>Let&apos;s talk about condoms <\/strong><\/p><p>For one, gals (read ladies) don&apos;t like them.

As it is, money has been and continues to be the bridge, so to say, between the islands of the haves and the lowlands of the have nots. And anyone who desires to walk into the sunny beaches of comfort within the stupendous island of riches must hustle and shake hands with some serious money.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Sad reality<\/strong><br \/>First, the economic lag that exists in Kenya has left many people drowning in poor standards of living. A disturbing statistic released in 2017 by Business Daily indicated that Kenya&apos;s youth unemployment sits at a comfortable rate of 20.3 per cent (for the 15-24 years age bracket). This creates a situation where the most energetic and creative labour is rendered idle while the aged and unproductive folk keep floating in top offices making very little contribution to the already struggling economy. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Second, universities and colleges continue to cough out graduates. The Daily Nation Newspaper of 24th Dec 2017 revealed that universities and colleges churn out tens of thousands of graduates each year. The saddest part, however, is that with few companies hitherto, the job market is not prepared to absorb all that labor.&nbsp;<\/p><p>In 2015 alone, we had around 49,000 graduates. The number has since increased.&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>More demons for the youths!<\/strong><br \/>Beside the lack of substantive job placement for youths, there is the lack of capital for business startups. There are many young people who are passionate about pursuing business but do not have the necessary funds to invest. So far, no relevant government agency has sufficiently fueled these prospects. There have been youth funds and Uwezo funds but both of these remain obscured in bureaucracy and inaccessible to many youths. &nbsp;<\/p><p>Those who successfully roll out their businesses have marketing challenges or inadequate market to contend with. It almost feels hopeless for the Kenyan youth. &nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Flickers of hope<\/strong><br \/>Writing to get paid, or online writing as others call it, is open to all fresh graduates. This is a job whose requirements are not overly exaggerated. You don&apos;t need a 10-year experience or a prominent resume to enter the industry; rather, all you need is your computer keyboard and strong internet connection.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Who doesn&apos;t want to work from the comfort of their homes and earn the same or even more than a salaried employee?&nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Caveat: money is like honey with bees that sting<\/strong><br \/>That every cloud has a silver lining is popular knowledge. But how I wish they also noted that behind every cloud with a silver lining lies a probable chance of lighting and thunder. Why? Because it&apos;s true that every beautiful rose has a thorn beneath and therefore must be touched carefully.<\/p><p>The online writing gig could bring huge sums of money. This calls for careful spending, lest you find yourself drawn into poor prioritization and all manner of insidious behavior that might leave you with tears. &nbsp;<\/p><p><strong>Get some financial education<\/strong><br \/>Your online bosses won&apos;t teach you how to use the money. They will give it to you but not ever show you how to manage it. So, ensure you get some financial education &ndash; everyone needs it.<\/p><p><strong>Write, Think, Invest<\/strong><br \/>The best place for your money is not banking, it&apos;s investing. When you invest, you provide the money with opportunity to have an intercourse with ideas and give birth to more money. Security is in prosperity not safety.

So I install myself on one of those public benches in town just to ponder.<\/p><p>It&apos;s then that I get distracted by a dramatic scene barely 10 metres away from where I&#39;m&nbsp;sitting: the sight of a&nbsp;guy in tatters, quite dirty; his&nbsp;skin bruised and tattooed with scars. He has one leg and is supporting himself with crutches. Strategically positioned among parked cars, the guy&nbsp;begs for cash from every willing (and unwilling) passerby.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Studying him closely, I notice that the man seems quite disturbed and rather agitated. He repeatedly throws his hands in the air when he gets nothing but an excuse from those he is begging from. He then lights a cigarette and smokes it riotously. 5 minutes, and the poor chap has finished 2 cigarettes.<\/p><p><strong>Cigar, a new painkiller? <\/strong><\/p><p>Those who smoke cigarette always do it with a certain swag; a kind of complacency and sense of wholeness that makes the act appear quite enjoyable. But that was not the case with this poor chap in front me. He seemed to be into this to whisk away his pain. His was a suicidal smoking!<\/p><p>So I thought to myself, &ldquo;Perhaps this dude lost a job or looked for one and failed to secure any. Then in his missions to hustle his way through the city, he got run over by a train, maybe, or some machine as monstrous as a train and had one of his legs amputated.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;Then perhaps his wife or girlfriend left him because he was almost functionally useless. He must have gotten a wrong woman, so she ran away to find herself a greener pasture. This man was then left lonely and sad, perhaps. It&apos;s likely in this spirit of resentment and bitterness that the chap then plunged himself into begging and heavy smoking.&rdquo;<\/p><p>This man must have failed to find the faint lines of positivity in the life. Maybe he thought that life taxed him too much and lost the sense of belonging to himself. He then must have sold his heart away!<\/p><p>The man seemed to not understand why the people he begged could not see his situation and sympathize with him. So he was in a mission to destroy his body, smoking away every coin that he got in the streets. His life was depleting, yet he didn&apos;t care much.<\/p><p><strong>Do<\/strong>n&apos;t Qu<strong>it<\/strong><\/p><p>Paradoxically, the very man wore a T-shirt with the inscription, <strong><em>Do<\/em><\/strong><em>n&apos;t Qu<strong>it<\/strong><\/em><strong>. <\/strong>Apparently, he only seemed to single out the &apos;Do it&apos; part of the slogan! Lost in negativity, the man just keeps <em>doing it<\/em>. And he is not quitting!<\/p><p>He represents many people out there, who keep getting <em>it <\/em>wrong.<\/p><p>There are many a people who have made costly decisions as a result of resentment and bitterness. It&apos;s quite true that sometimes life can put you on the edge of a precipice and roll you over for a fall.

Most people tend dip their heads in their achievements so much so that they think about nothing else.<\/p><p>Success is precious. It finally gives you the ability to lead the life of your dreams; dress as you want, drive your dream car. Having all the money means you can now do <em>anything<\/em> you want. And right there, at the top, you can get quite complacent &ndash; thinking only about how to keep the money flowing. But have you ever stopped to ask:<\/p><p><strong>What if I lost everything and had to start from scratch?<\/strong><\/p><p>Legendary marketer Russell Brunson&nbsp;some time back sent a brief email to his &apos;Two Comma Club&apos; award winners. Inside the email was one question. &nbsp;It read:<\/p><p>Losing everything<\/p><p>&ldquo;You suddenly lose EVERYTHING in your business (Your money, your big name, your list, your affiliates and partners, all of it!) ... You have bills piled high, school fees staring at you, people harassing you for money over the phone...Other than your vast marketing experience, you&apos;re back to being a NEWBIE...What EXACTLY would you do...to SAVE yourself?&rdquo;<\/p><p>You are a successful entrepreneur, money has started or is already flowing. You look at where you have come from, the past struggles, fears, hurdles, setbacks...and sheepishly smile at them. You are headed to the top. Self-actualization.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Then, as though all of a sudden, all that is gone! What would you do to provide for yourself, your family...what would you do, really?<\/p><p><strong>Starting from zero<\/strong><\/p><p>Nick Hornby admits that it&apos;s hard trying to rebuild yourself, piece by piece, with no guidebook to refer to and no clue as to where all the important bits went to. With no company to your name, no job, no roof over your head. All you have got is charred remains of what used to be a fortune. Deep within you, you know you should be able to figure it out but you have no clue what figuring out is supposed to look like.<\/p><p>In one of his quotes, Aberjhni says that a bridge of silver wings stretches from the dead ashes of an unforgiving nightmare of a jeweled life started a new. To mean there is plenty where the other(s) had come from. You just need to stop brooding over the spilt milk. Instead, stand to your feet and proclaim that you can do it. If you did it once, you can definitely do it again.<\/p><p>For the newbies, if you can imagine it, you can do it. The law of attraction states that you attract to yourself what you proclaim. The universe faithfully duplicates or mirrors your thoughts and emotions then brings them to you in form of physical reality.<\/p><p>That&apos;s how life is: unpredictable. And without some form of universal general insurance to always fall back to, you have to prepare for <em>life<\/em>. Whatever fortune you own now might come tumbling down within seconds. Make plans, draw your board, and have a diversified mind. Contemplate the unforeseen possibilities &ndash; then prepare for them.<\/p><p>Now tell me, what if you lost&nbsp;everything today and had to begin from scratch?<\/p>","content_min":"<p>We are all chasing after one thing in this life.
